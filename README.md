# PartyGame

## A multiplayer party game on the browser.
I decided to start this in hopes of creating a swift networking project. By this I mean
in hopes of learning how to create and manage game servers on a network. As well as this 
my other objective was to maybe publish this game once I had created multiple gamemodes
as this could be something that could be played by people. awdawdawdaw
